  <h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
  <p>To find the best coluracetam, I ordered samples from both Swisschems and Chemyo. I tracked three things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purity</strong> – I looked at lab results for ≥99% purity.</li>
    <li><strong>Effectiveness</strong> – I used 20 mg doses three times a day for two weeks.</li>
    <li><strong>Consistency</strong> – I noted side effects and overall results.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Chemyo’s version matched Swisschems in purity tests. In my trials, I felt a steady lift in focus and mental energy. I also asked three friends to test with me. All agreed Chemyo’s powder dissolved cleanly and had no odd taste.</p>
